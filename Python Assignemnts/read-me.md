# Steps for Creating and Executing the Python Code
1.`Define a Function to Check for Prime Numbers`

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is a prime number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
    
```
.It handles small numbers and checks for divisibility. For larger numbers, it uses a loop to test divisibility up to the square root of n.

2.`Define the Main Function`

```python
def main():
    # Introduction
    print("Welcome to the Interactive Number Tool!")

    # Get user name
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Let's explore your favorite numbers.")

```
`Logic:` Prints a welcome message and asks for the user's name. It then displays a personalized greeting.

3. `Collect Favorite Numbers from the User`
```python
 numbers = []
    for i in range(3):
        while True:
            try:
                number = int(input(f"Enter favorite number {i+1}: "))
                numbers.append(number)
                break
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")
```
`Logic:` Uses a loop to prompt the user for numbers, validates the input to ensure it is an integer, and appends valid numbers to the numbers list.

4. `Determine If Each Number Is Even or Odd`

```python
even_odd_info = [(num, "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd") for num in numbers]

    # Print even/odd information
    print("\nEven/Odd Analysis:")
    for num, kind in even_odd_info:
        print(f"The number {num} is {kind}.")
```
`Logic:` Uses a list comprehension to check if each number is even or odd, stores this information in tuples, and prints it.

5. `Print Each Number and Its Square`
```python
print("\nNumber and Its Square:")
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"The square of {num} is {num ** 2}.")
```
`logic:` Iterates through the numbers list and prints each number and its square

6. `Calculate the Sum of the Numbers and Check for Primality`

```python
total_sum = sum(numbers)
    print(f"\nThe sum of your favorite numbers is: {total_sum}")

    # Check if the sum is a prime number
    if is_prime(total_sum):
        print(f"Great job! {total_sum} is a prime number!")
    else:
        print(f"Interesting! {total_sum} is not a prime number.")
```

7. `Execute the Main Function`
``` python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
